We're using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get weather data on different cities. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out [Issues](/issues) for some more ideas!

You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a `.env` file.
